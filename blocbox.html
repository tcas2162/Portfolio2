								 <h2>Summary</h2>
								<p>I was tasked with designing Blocbox, a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application which allows people to collect information and store it in a single place. A user would be able to create simple documents, store images, links to websites, and collaborate with others.</p>

								 <h2>The Problem</h2>
								<p>Several problems exist with the current methods of saving and sharing items online and there does not seem to be a clear consensus of a website that stands out among the rest. Many people primarily save items as favorites on their preferred web browser because it's either the only way of saving or sharing content they know how to use, or because they like the ease of recalling and searching bookmarks. People who primarily save and share items on social media sites such as Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter sometimes lose track of bookmarks, as these sites do not allow you to categorically sort your saved items. Meanwhile, sites like Box or Dropbox are too expensive and too complex for casual needs.

					<div class="container">
						<div class="block_contentin block_contentin2">
							<div class="block_content_text">
								<h2>The Solution</h2>
								<p>Blocbox would be a website that would allow users to learn more about the product from an initial landing page, then subsequently sign up and/or sign in with E-mail, Facebook and Twitter. After signing up/in, a primary dashboard would display which would give users the ability to add and/or view images, links and text-based documents. Additionally, users would be able to add collaborators who can view the original user’s content and make edits of their own as well. Blocbox would have three pricing tiers-Free, Professional, $5 per month, and Expert, $10 per month. This would satisfy the requirement of affordable pricing while also differentiating the offerings, with two specific options for those who are looking for a casual experience and one for the user seeking to use the site for business purposes. Above all, the site would be user-friendly and easy to navigate for people of all ages. </p>

									<p><span>Box</span> positions itself as a solution for both individual users and businesses. Box offer a free basic subscription for the personal user and three different pricing tiers for businesses. Box also has excellent connectivity with major apps like Salesforce and Chatter. Box’s online document editing is not as strong as others in it’s space and it's possible to become overwhelmed by all of these different package options. Blocbox would need to overcome the threat of an already oversaturated market and the flexibility that Box allows with it’s app connectivity and instantaneous downloads features.</p>

									<p><span>Evernote</span>positions itself as a solution for both consumers and businesses. It is clear that they are targeting the more cost-conscious purchaser, with three pricing options for the general user and one, flat $12 per month per user model for businesses. The general look and feel of their website-with bright colors and some hand-drawn illustrations-seems to scream that they are geared more for personal use and/or the creative professional, as opposed to the corporate world. Like Box, Evernote also allows for collaboration between multiple users for the sharing and editing of notes. Evernote's ease of use, low prices and stronger brand recognition are immediate threats to Blocbox right out of the gate.</p>

									<p class="pad_last"><span>Dropbox</span>is among the most popular and widely-used mobile cloud storage service among professionals. It has an elegant style and works well with all major OS offerings-Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. Dropbox is not as user-friendly as Evernote. The user can manually customize to their liking, but it is much more time-consuming to organize than in the aforementioned apps.Dropbox can be beat by offering easier options for organization and more affordable options (less than $12) for price and storage. Dropbox’s greatest threats to Blocbox are that it is tremendously popular and allows sharing of all file sizes across many, if not all, devices.</p>

								<p>When designing the Blocbox logo, I wanted to create something simple, yet iconic, much as Apple has with their insignia, as well as Facebook and Google have with their iconic “F” and “G” logos, specifically. I settled on the rounded rectangle box, (far right,) to evoke a simple logo that “just works,” as Apple would say. I also spaced out and centered the Blocbox logo, drawing inspiration from a  style similar to Apple’s typeface to complete the logo as well. I broke the typography down as follows:
								</p>
								<p>I started out with Roboto as my heading typeface and Lora as my paragraph typeface. After some experimenting, I chose to flip the two-setting Lora as the heading typeface and Roboto as the paragraph typeface. I felt that Lora did not mesh as well with a smaller character size. Once I began building the mock-ups, I noticed that Lora felt out of place entirely, so I switched to a Roboto Slab typeface for the heading. I felt that this was a better fit for the theme and identity that I was trying to evoke with Blocbox.
 								</p>
								<p class="pad_last">When it came to deciding on a color scheme, I've always liked wood/faux-wood accessories (i.e. chairs, tables, my own car dashboard, etc.) and I wanted to create something that evokes a high-quality, elegant finish as these items do. I've kept the general templates the same, but created a color swatch in various shades of beige and brown, while using a dark brown color to make the text pop out. I've chosen orange to differentiate the call to action button from the other elements of the dashboard, creating a uniquely colored button, but one that is not radically different from the other shades of brown contained within the dashboard.

								<p>I used Balsamiq to begin creating low fidelity wireframes for Blocbox. It was important to create a simple, yet elegant site that featured prominent, immediate calls to action, along with transparent pricing and user testimonials. After conducting preference testing on three different landing pages, the final one above on the far right was the overwhelming favorite, so I began to design around that concept. I also created mockups of the sign up and sign in flows as well. </p>
								<p class="pad_last">Wireframes that illustrated the dashboard experience for the user were also created. These wireframes illustrated what a user would see after first signing up, what the dashboard would look like once items were added and what the account settings page would look like. It was important to map out how the user would update their account, so that experience was accounted for in the final wireframe shown above.</p>

								<p>Next, I began designing high fidelity wireframes in Adobe Illustrator. There was only one minor change to the finalized wireframes-the features section of the landing page was changed to a horizontal orientation as opposed to the vertical orientation seen in the original wireframes. In the early stages of the design process of these wireframes, I experimented with a dashboard interface that had a horizontal navigation (seen in the final two wireframes above,) as opposed to the vertical navigation present in the initial wireframes. After conferring with my mentor, Chris, we determined that the vertical navigation was the better of the two options, because it was more user friendly and simpler than the UI for a dashboard with horizontal navigation would be. A horizontal dashboard would have required several different dropdown menu options to account for all of the actions that a user could take, which would clutter the page and increase the chances that the user may accidentally click on a link other than the one they intended.</p>

								<p>After viewing the landing page, Andrew attempted to log in to the site and complete the tasks of adding a link and changing his account settings. Andrew was able to successfully add a link and change his account settings, stating, “that was easy.” He said that he liked the colors and layout, but that the text on the pop-up menus was too light and a strain on the eyes. He stated, “The biggest problem I have is reading that text that appears under that back button/status bar. That’s hard for me to read… it’s going to be hard to read for some people.” Andrew suggested making this text brighter in order to prevent strain on the eyes, a change which was accounted for in the final version seen below. </p>

									<h2>Final User Testing</h2>
									<p>Before deploying the final version of Blocbox, I ran a few user tests on Usability Hub to ensure that I was making the correct design decisions in three key areas. The first test was a five second test used to find out if visitors to the site could correctly identify what the site was for and also asked if the brand appeared trustworthy.</p>

								</div>
								<div class="insight">
									<p>The insights gleaned from this test were that:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><p>88% of users were able to correctly identify that this was a type of storage site that allowed you to share notes, images and links, as well as collaborate with others.  </p></li>
										<li><p>The remaining 12% could not articulate what the site was for and stated that they needed more time to view the content on the landing page.</p></li>
										<li><p>76% of those surveyed stated that the brand seemed trustworthy, 12% stated that the brand seemed “somewhat trustworthy,” while the remaining 12% stated that it the brand did not seem trustworthy.</p></li>
										<li><p>Those who did not find the site trustworthy felt this way because a combination of the color scheme, the layout of the landing page and the large text made this look like a “spamming site with loads of viruses.” </p></li>
									</ul>
									<p>The second test was a preference test that gave users two options for the placement of the “Add” button on the dashboard, then asked them which option they preferred.</p>

								<p>The results of this preference test indicated that 80% of users preferred the first option (above, left.) The reasons for this choice varied between it “being more obvious up top,” “remaining visible after more items are added” and “still draws attention up top as a result of the distinct call-to-action color.” </p>

								<p class="pad_last">Now that I had completed this final round of user testing, I designed a responsive website for the landing and dashboard pages, then successfully deployed the Blocbox project.</p>

								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								 <p>This was my first design project, so in addition to learning the ins and outs of the design process, I would say that the most rewarding parts of this project were learning the ropes of an agile development process, learning how to conduct user interviews and building user personas. Building this site was a great exercise in building a basic foundation of knowledge in the field of User Experience Design and I intend to keep working to increase my knowledge and skill level. </p>
								<p class="pad_last">In closing, I have learned that it’s not about reinventing from a UI perspective, nor is it about what the designer thinks works best. In contrast, it’s about learning what works best for users and reiterating on designs until you can deploy a product that is accessible and as user-friendly for as many people as possible. This was a good starting point towards those goals and I look forward to applying the knowledge I’ve begun to learn here to build bigger and better applications in the future.</p>
